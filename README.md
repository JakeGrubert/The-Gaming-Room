# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is going to have a game created called “Draw It or Lose It” which is web-based and available on numerous platforms.  Currently this game is only accessible on android but may have more systems to operate on.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I crafted an extensive section of recommendations that highlights crucial aspects the client should ponder. These aspects encompass the host operating system, strategies for memory and storage management on host servers, the API framework, security measures, and the advantages of adopting a serverless architecture for product launch. I presented a compelling argument for why opting for a cloud platform aligns perfectly with the client's objectives and interests.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Examining the domain model as illustrated through a UML class diagram yielded advantages in grasping the configuration and interconnections among the entities symbolizing the application components. This aided in crafting succinct classes housing uncomplicated methods, which effectively utilized other entities in a straightforward manner, resulting in the creation of a coherent prototype.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Enhancements could be made to the evaluation segment, which involves a comparison of well-known operating systems (namely Mac, Windows, and Linux) as well as mobile platforms. Delving further into the intricacies differentiating these platforms from a client-side perspective would provide a richer analysis. Of particular importance is the web browser, which serves as the primary client-side focal point, acting as the core engine that drives the client's application experience. While the investigation into the disparities between operating systems for web-centric solutions yielded modest insights, it would be advantageous to conduct a more comprehensive examination. This could involve a deeper exploration of how specific operating systems tend to align with particular browsers (such as Windows with Edge and Mac with Safari). The objective would be to ascertain whether the use of non-preferred browsers introduces any technical or performance limitations that merit thorough consideration.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Primary considerations during the development of web-based applications should revolve around addressing crucial user requirements, specifically centered on speed and intuitiveness (referred to as usability). While qualities such as aesthetics and overall appeal (commonly referred to as "look and feel") hold significance, their importance pales in comparison to the paramount significance of speed and usability. Users might choose to persist with an application despite aesthetic reservations, but they are more likely to abandon it if the functionality is unclear or if the application's performance is sluggish. Recognizing that users serve as the fundamental consumers of the product, their needs stand as the utmost priority, given that they constitute the ultimate source of revenue for the client.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When embarking on software design, initiate with a broad perspective and gradually refine it to achieve precision. Commence with overarching goals and subject them to a series of iterative processes that culminate in the ultimate solution. For instance, a client's business aspirations can be deconstructed into functional requirements, which elucidate the essential components of functionality necessary to attain those objectives. These functional requirements can then be subdivided into technical requisites, delineating the technical strategies for realizing the desired functions. Subsequently, these technical requisites can be transformed into comprehensive design documents, architectural blueprints, and actual code implementation, thereby fulfilling the stipulated requirements and yielding the final, refined solution.
